- **Bookmark:** Save & categorize favorite channels with JSON import/export, quick-access mini stats, and fast switching.
- **DDL:** Download video (144p–4K) or audio (MP3 128–320kbps) with bulk mode, plus subtitles (SRT/TXT/XML with auto-translate) — all without leaving YouTube.
- **Settings:** 35 themes, adjustable panel layout & pagination, and video player utilities: loop, frame-accurate screenshot (copy/download as JPG, PNG, or WebP), and more.
